For simplicity these three are used in the following examples: absolute, relative and fixed. Positioning can apply to any block element; the examples that follow concentrate on use with div boxes (div tags) which are block elements and they make probably the commonest use of positions.
Position: static; is the default where, if it doesn't have any top, right, bottom or left positions, a block element just follows in the order of the code and starts a new line. It isn't usually necessary to state position: static unless you want to cancel one of the other properties. [Inline elements will be on the same line if there is room and position doesn't apply].
